The Party Van by Rodrigo Constanzo
==================================

The Party Van is a live sampling and performance instrument built using Max. It was programmed around the Monome 64 and Arc 2 controllers but includes mapping for an iPad running TouchOSC (custom layout included) as well as the Keith McMillen Softstep foot controller. The patch will work just fine with larger Monomes and Arcs. Additionally, the patch has MIDI learn functionality built in, so every parameter can be mapped to any MIDI controller. Finally, control output of a Shbobo Shnth can be mapped to The Party Van as well.
